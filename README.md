# Computer Vision Experiment

Our experiment was designed to analyze different techniques of Face Recognition. We tried to check the precision of FisherFaces, EigenFaces, and LBPH using different approaches. We used <b>opencv-face-recognition-python</b> and a factorial experiment approach to check the precision.

# PS:
This was a very, very, very small college project. So, expect some methodological errors. The main purpose was to learn about Face Recognition.
